## Summary of Findings

- This data covers three areas: San Francisco, East Bay and San Jos√©
- There are alot more male users than other users, for all areas there are always over 64% male
- There are a lot more subscribers than customer using this service
- The average user over all data is most likely between 24 and 35 years old
- People use the bikes more/in higher counts during the week than during the weekend
- The majority of trips are less than 2km long.
- There is an increasing trend of usage
- People start their trips most frequently at 8 and 17 'o clock

During this project I had to clean the data and used folium to plot the Lat Long start and finish locations to visualise the journeys.
I analysed the data by plotting exploratory graphs, then used Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate graphs to further explore the relationships and trends od duration and distances cycled by age, gender and user type.
I felt ther was no major surprises from the findings, other than males were the majority of users.
